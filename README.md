# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) or stay using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  
A Streamlit web app is used for easy user interaction and real-time predictions.
